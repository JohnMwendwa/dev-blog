## How your data is saved 🔐
In all the projects I undertake, data privacy is always my number one priority.
- Passwords: All your passwords are securely hashed to the extent that even  the one who manages the database cannot know your password.
- Emails: the emails you provide are only used for authentication purposes and are never shared with any third party person or organization
- Names: You name is yours and yours only but remember names are not entirely unique, so when you see an article with a similar name to yours but a different author image, know that's not your article and there is no need of panicking.
- Images: the images such as your user profile image is used and displayed in all your articles.

## Wrong Email 📧
Incase you had provided the wrong email initially and you never received a verification email, please go to `settings` on the user dashboard, then to `account settings` and edit your email then press the **Update information** button. After updating your email, click the `Dashboard` home link, then click the send verification email button. An email will be sent to your email inbox with a verification link.

## Verification 🔓
Incase you use your computer to signup and and then you open the verification email link using your phone, you'll have to logout of your computer and then log back in again in order to see the articles link.

## Account Termination ❌
Incase you want to terminate your account, please note it is a very easy process:
1. Go to settings page
2. Click `account settings`
3. Then click `Delete Account` button
**Note**: Please note that incase you had written any articles prior to deleting your account, all the articles will be deleted and **CAN NEVER** be recovered

## Forgot Password 🔑
Incase you forgot your password:
1. Go to `Login` page and click forgot password link
2. Enter your email address
3. A password reset link will be sent to your email
4. Enter your new password and confirm it then click the `Reset Password` email
